# SimpleMoistureMonitoring
This project is a proof of concept of how temperature, humidity and soil moisture data can be sent to a cloud service (in this case Antares IoT Cloud service). Based on the data from the cloud, we can execute some command like turning on a water pump to keep the intended moisture level when it falls below some threshold
